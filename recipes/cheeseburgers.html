    <p>So most people have some sort of secret ingredient. But I don't. So let's jump in to it:</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cheeseburger Buns</li>
        <li>Hamburger Meat</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by forming your hamburger meat into patties twice the size of the buns you have.</li>
        <li>As each patty is being formed, sprinkle each side with salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Fry your hamburger patties in a pan or grill them. For each cooking method, allow them to cook on one side until
            they appear almost cooked through, then flip them and finish them off.
        </li>
        <li>Once finished cooking, place hamburger patties on bun, dress with option condiments, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
